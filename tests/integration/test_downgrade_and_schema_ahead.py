"""Integration test for the downgrade drill packaging standards §6.1 promises.

"Downgrading the application without downgrading the database is refused, not attempted: a
database ahead of the code raises ``SchemaAhead`` at startup and names both revisions and the
backup directory. A supported downgrade path is: stop the application, restore the automatic
pre-migration backup, install the older version." Until this test, nothing in any of the four
applications' suites drove that drill end to end (M9_AUDIT.md Group 3, item O2) — this is the
one that does, on LoadCoach's own bootstrap path.
